  type: Controller # models can reuse the same type
  parameters:
    soc_min: 0  # Minimum state of charge of the battery before discharging stops
    soc_max: 100  # Maximum state of charge of the battery before charging stops
    h2_soc_min: 0  # Minimum state of charge of the hydrogen storage before discharging stops

    fc_eff: 100  # Efficiency of the fuel cell
  inputs:
    wind_gen: 0  # Wind power generation
    pv_gen: 0  # Solar power generation
