- name: Wind1
  type: Wind # models can reuse the same type
  parameters:
    p_rated: 73548  # Rated power output (kW) of the wind turbine at the rated wind speed and above.
    u_rated: 100  # Rated wind speed (m/s) where the wind turbine reaches its maximum power output.
    u_cutin: 1  # Cut-in wind speed (m/s) below which the wind turbine does not generate power.
    u_cutout: 1000  # Cut-out wind speed (m/s) above which the wind turbine stops generating power to prevent damage.
    cp: 0.40  # Coefficient of performance of the wind turbine, typically around 0.40 and never more than 0.59.
    diameter: 30  # Diameter of the wind turbine rotor (m), used in calculating the swept area for wind power production.
    output_type: 'power'  # Output type of the wind generation, either 'power' (kW) or 'energy' (kWh).
  inputs:
    u: 0  # Wind speed (m/s) at a specific height used to calculate the wind power generation.
  outputs:
    wind_gen: 0  # Generated wind power output (kW) or energy (kWh) based on the chosen output type (power or energy).
    u: 0  # Adjusted wind speed (m/s) at 25m height after converting from the original height (e.g., 100m or 60m).
