# Illuminator
The Illuminator is an easy-to-use Energy System Integration 
Development kit to demystify energy system's operation, illustrate challenges 
that arise due to the energy transition and test 
state-of-the-art energy management concepts. 
The kit utilises Raspberry Pi's as individual components of an energy system emulator, 
and the simulation engine is based on [Mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/).

## Installation

**Requirements** 
- Python >= 3.8 & < 3.12
- Miniconda (optional)
- A Rasberry Pi cluster, for cluster deployment (optional)

### Using Pip

The simplest way to install *Illuminator* is from PYPI, using `pip`:

```shell
pip install illuminator
```

### Using Conda

The `environment.yml` provides all dependecies to create a conda environment called **illuminator**.

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate illuminator
```

> Refer to the [Quick Start](https://illuminator-team.github.io/Illuminator/quick-start.html) guide for a brief explanation on how to set up and run your first simulation.


### Illuminator Raspberry Pi Cluster

> Refer to the [Cluster Pi Setup](https://illuminator-team.github.io/Illuminator/developer/dev-cluster-setup.html) documentation for instructions on how to set up an Illuminator cluster.
