# Illuminator
The Illuminator is an easy-to-use Energy System Integration 
Development kit to demystify energy system's operation, illustrate challenges 
that arise due to the energy transition and test 
state-of-the-art energy management concepts. 
The kit utilises Raspberry Pi's as individual components of an energy system emulator, 
and the simulation engine is based on [Mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/).

## Installation

**Requirements** 
- The toolkit requires a RaspberryPi cluster with at least two nodes. But Illuminator can alos be installed in a PC.
- Miniconda (optional)

### Using Conda

The `environment.yml` provides all dependecies to create a conda environment called **Ecosystem**.

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate Ecosystem
```

## Raspberry Pi Setup

The setup for the Illuminator requires one **master** Raspberry Pi and several **clients** Raspberry Pi's.
Raspberry Pi's must be connected and configured as a local network, and the
*master* must be configured to have permissions to access and control the *clients* through Secure Shell Protocol (SSH).

During simulation, the *master* engage with the *clients* to run the simulations defined in the *simulation configuration*, and
information is exchanged between Rasberry Pi's using network sockets.
The **master** provides a Dashboard to viazulize the results, and saves them to a `.csv` files for later analysis.

### Set up a Raspberry Pi cluster

1. [Install Raspberry pi OS using Raspberry Pi imager.](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Set an static IP addresse for each Raspberry Pi. Use the following command on the terminal to open the `dhcpcd.conf` file:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
   ```

   In the `dhcpcd.conf` file, find the information to change the IP address as static as following:

   ```
   interface etho
   static ip_address=192.168.0.1/24 # change the IP address as you want
   ```
   Finally, reboot the Raspberry Pi suing `sudo reboot` on the terminal.
3. [Configure SSH connections so that the *master* can connect to the *clients* without a password.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2)
4. Install the following Python packages.
   ```
   pandas
   tk
   python-csv
   datetime
   python-math
   numpy
   scipy
   arrow
   mosaik
   mosaik_api
   mosaik.util
   wandb
   matplotlib
   itertools
   ```
5. Send the Illuminator package [TODO: What is the illuminator package?] to all *clients*. Use the following command on the *master's* terminal to check the connection  between *master* and the *clients*

   ```shell
   ssh illuminator@ip #ip represent your follower IP address
   ```
   [TODO: This suggest that all Pi's need a user with the name 'illuminator']

6. Run the `buildcilentremoterun.py` file on each *client* and give all users execute permission to all the documents in `runshfile/` in order 
to make sure the leader can access the *client* model.
   
   ```shell
   chmod -R a+X *dir*
   ```

More detialed instructions are given in the [user guide document](docs/user/user-guide.md) and the [model build up document](Models.md).

## PC Setup

To install 
the Illuminator in one regular PC: 

1. Clone this repository. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Illuminator-team/Illuminator.git
```

2. Create a conda environement using the YAML file in the root of the repository, as follows:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate Ecosystem
```

3. Refer to the [documenation](illuminator-team.github.io/Illuminator) for an explanation on how to set up and run a simulation.
