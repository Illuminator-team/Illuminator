# Illuminator
The Illuminator is an easy-to-use Energy System Integration 
Development kit to demystify energy system's operation, illustrate challenges 
that arise due to the energy transition and test 
state-of-the-art energy management concepts. 
The kit utilises Raspberry Pi's as individual components of an energy system emulator, 
and the simulation engine is based on [Mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/).

## Installation

**Requirements** 
- Python >= 3.8
- Miniconda (optional)
- A Rasberry Pi cluster, for cluster deplyment ( [cluster set up](cluster-setup.md) for specific instructions)

### Using Pip

The simpliest way to install *Illuminator* is from PYPI, using `pip`:

```shell
pip install illuminator
```

### Using Conda

The `environment.yml` provides all dependecies to create a conda environment called **illuminator**.

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate illuminator
```

> Refer to the [documenation](https://illuminator-team.github.io/Illuminator/quick-start.html#usage) for an explanation on how to set up and run a simulation.


## Raspberry Pi Setup

The setup for the Illuminator requires one **server** Raspberry Pi and several **clients** Raspberry Pi's.
Raspberry Pi's must be connected and configured as a local network, and the
*server* must be configured to have permissions to access and control the *clients* through Secure Shell Protocol (SSH).

During simulation, the *server* engage with the *clients* to run the simulations defined in the *simulation configuration*, and
information is exchanged between Rasberry Pi's using network sockets.
The **server** provides a Dashboard to viazulize the results, and saves them to a `.csv` files for later analysis.

### Set up 

Consult the [Cluster Pi Setup](docs/cluster-setup.md) document for instructions on how to set up a cluster.
