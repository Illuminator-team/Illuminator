# Illuminator
The Illuminator is a user-friendly development kit for simulating integrated energy systems.
It supports the design of energy systems, the testing of advanced energy management concepts, and the demonstration of challenges posed by the energy transition.
Illuminator builts on [Mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/), and supports both stand-alone simulations and distributed computing.

> See [documenation](https://illuminator-team.github.io/Illuminator/quick-start.html#usage) for an explanation on how to set up and run a simulation.
