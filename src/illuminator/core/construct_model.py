    ----------
    simulator_type: SimulatorType.TIME_BASED
        Defines how the simulator is advanced through time and whether its attributes are persistent in time or transient
    model_name: str
        The name of the model
    public: bool
        Determines whether a model can be instantiated by a user 
    parameters: list 
        Variables which values can be set when instantiating the model (can this be always considered inputs?)
    attrs: list 
        Model properties that can be read from (can these be always considered outputs?)
    trigger: list 
        Attribute names that cause the simulator to be stepped when another simulator provides output which is connected to one of those.
        Empty if no triggers.
    inputs: list
        ???
