        self._entities : list
            Return a list of dictionaries describing the created model instances (entities). 
            The root list must contain exactly `num` elements. The number of objects in sub-lists is not constrained::

        The entity ID (*eid*) of an object must be unique within a simulator instance. For entities in the root list, `type` must be the same as the
        `model` parameter. The type for objects in sub-lists may be anything that can be found in ``meta['models']``. *rel* is an optional list of
        related entities; "related" means that two entities are somehow connect within the simulator, either logically or via a real data-flow (e.g.,
        grid nodes are related to their adjacent branches). The *children* entry is optional and may contain a sub-list of entities.

        Time-based simulators have set an entry for all requested attributes, whereas for event-based and hybrid simulators this is optional (e.g.
        if there's no new event). Event-based and hybrid simulators can optionally set a timing of their non-persistent output attributes via a *time* entry, which is valid
        for all given (non-persistent) attributes. If not given, it defaults to the current time of the step. Thus only one output time is possible
        per step. For further output times the simulator has to schedule another self-step (via the step's return value).
