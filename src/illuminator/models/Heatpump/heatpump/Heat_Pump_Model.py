    Simulation model of a heat pump based on the library TESPy.

    You have to provide the *params* dictionary that contains the parameters
    required for the design of the heat pump. It will look like this::

            'cons_T': 35,

    -*cons_T* is the temperature, in °C, at which heat is supplied to the consumer. This can
    be changed later in the simulation as well.

    -*heat_source_T* is the temperature, in °C, at which the ambient fluid (water or air)
    is available as the heat source.

    -*T_amb* is the ambient temperature, in °C.

    -*heat_source* is the fluid, either 'water' or 'air', that acts as the heat source for
    the system.
