# Dashboard

We are looking for an light-weigth opensource source solution for implementing a dasboard for the *Illuminator*. The main purspose of the dashboard is to display the simulations result during runtime, therefore a solution must provide visualisations in real-time. We haven't explore the posibilites, but [Graphana](https://grafana.com/) can be a candidate.

The ideas above can be use by contributors to participate in the development of *Illuminator*. Better ideas and solutions always welcome. Please contact the [Illuminator Development Team](mailto:illuminator@tudelft.nl) if you want to contribute.
