Illuminator documentation
=========================

The Illuminator is an easy-to-use Energy System Integration 
Development kit to demystify energy system operation, illustrate challenges 
that arise due to the energy transition and test 
state-of-the-art energy management concepts. we utilise Raspberry Pis
as the individual components of the energy system emulator, 
and the simulation engine is based on [Mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/).
