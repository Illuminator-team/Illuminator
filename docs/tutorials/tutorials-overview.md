## Tutorial Instructions
There are two ways to run the Illuminator tutorials currently: Locally and on web, we recomment the former for users who plan on using the Illuminator software actively and the latter for educators or students who wish to familiarise themselves with energy system interactions and not the software itself.

### Running Tutorials Locally
We endorse any aspiring Illuminator developers to run the tutorials locally. This will serve as an excellent starting point in familiarising yourself with the configuration file, set up and structure of the Illuminator.

Make sure you have Illuminator installed in your system.

1. Download the jupyter notebook of the tutorial by clicking the `Download Notebook` button.
2. Download the configuration (yaml) and input files (csv) of each tutorial by clicking the `Download ZIP` button.
3. Extract the files and ensure they are in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the notebook and run the cells. The notebook itself executes the simulations and allows you to make changes in the configuration file of the simulation (yaml) through simple functions.

### Running Tutorials on Web (Colab)
Each tutorial is hosted in a google colab environment. This serves as an excellent starting point if you do not have python in your system, since you can run everything remotely. You do not need to download the jupyter notebook as it is hosted online within the linked colab environment. 

Make sure you have internet access.

1. Download the configuration (yaml) and input files (csv) of each tutorial by clicking the `Download ZIP` button.
2. Extract the files and ensure they are in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the linked colab notebook and upload the extracted files under the content dir of the colab environment.
4. Run the cells. The notebook itself executes the simulations and allows you to make changes in the configuration file of the simulation (yaml) through simple functions.

Any changes you make to the linked colab notebooks will be lost once your session has ended. The same is true for your uploaded files. If you wish to save your version of the notebook, make a copy of the colab notebook to your drive.
